## Overview

This Password Manager is a Python-based application designed to securely store, manage, and retrieve your passwords. It allows users to save credentials for different accounts, generate strong passwords, and protect all data using encryption.

## Features

• Secure Storage: All passwords are encrypted before being saved.

• Password Generation: Generate strong, random passwords.

• Search Functionality: Quickly find stored credentials.

• User Authentication: Protect the application with a master password.

• Cross-Platform: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

 • Python 3.6 or higher

 • Required libraries (see requirements.txt)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

``git clone https://github.com/your-username/password-manager.git
cd password-manager``

2. Install dependencies:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

3. Run the application:

``python main.py``

## Usage

1. Launch the application.

2. Set a master password during the first run. Use this to log in to the application in the future.

3. Add new accounts by specifying the account name, username, and password.

4. Use the password generator to create strong passwords.

5. Search for saved credentials by account name.

## Security

• Passwords are encrypted using AES encryption (or another secure algorithm).

• The master password is hashed and never stored in plain text.

## Future Enhancements

• Add cloud synchronization for password backups.

• Implement two-factor authentication (2FA).

• Add a GUI interface for better user experience.
